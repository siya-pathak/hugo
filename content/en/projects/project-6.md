PizzaBae is a simple and user-friendly chatbot built on Telegram that helps customers order pizza quickly and easily.

* Customers can interact with PizzaBae via natural language, which makes it easier to navigate through the ordering process.
* Users simply message the chatbot, and it guides them through the process of selecting their preferred toppings, size, and crust, and then places the order for them.
* On finalizing of the order the customer is redirected to the checkout page.
