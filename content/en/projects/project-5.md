---
This was built as part of a hackathon by a team of 4.

The web portal aims to provide a platform for the students of Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW) to read and access blogs, articles, and papers, written by their peers at the university. The fundamental driving force behind this concept is to encourage technical writing among students and to increase peer reading and accessibility of university students' papers.
* User registration and login: This feature will allow students and staff of IGDTUW to create an account on the portal and login to access the technical writing section.
* Technical writing section: This feature will allow students and staff to browse, read and access technical writings, such as blogs, articles, and papers, written by their peers.
* Search and filter function: This feature will allow students and staff to easily search and filter through the writings to find the information they need, by topic or field of study,
* Writing submission feature: This feature will allow students and staff to submit their own technical writings on the portal for others to read.
