Through my exploration of open source, I've had the chance to contribute to Mozilla Firefox. I also had the opportunity to intern as a web developer at Cisco Thinqbator (IGDTUW branch). Presently, I'm delving into machine learning, seeking ways to apply its principles across various domains. Some of the technologies and tools I work/ have worked with are (in no particular order):

HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Bulma UI, shadcn/ui, JavaScript, Embedded JavaScript, NodeJS, Express, Git, Mercurial (Version Control System), Python, C++, C, Powershell, React, Machine Learning, Java, TypeScript, Flask, Hugo, Appwrite.

I also have good knowledge of algortithms, logic, programming, and its implementations, which I practice in C++. 

Besides development and programming I enjoy watching sports, listening to [music](https://l.instagram.com/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Fuser%2Fz2kchxwmuq8cf38llchg8qpu0%3Fsi%3D_DJ_FLXMRlGRh4ejalyneQ&e=AT3zmzh2sxz3D1Vh3tik_YSvdvEYOx3pKc6URjTmMMfz_TWBRqFK_hlr-8SprsbawQ_ZOgP1agSZhmR-k0W4GQogTdo3UsBguuMUf5fq8mzWGt-3CqPGPw) and [reading](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/supitssiya).
