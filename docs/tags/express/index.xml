      <description>This was built as part of a hackathon by a team of 4.
The web portal aims to provide a platform for the students of Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW) to read and access blogs, articles, and papers, written by their peers at the university. The fundamental driving force behind this concept is to encourage technical writing among students and to increase peer reading and accessibility of university students&amp;rsquo; papers.</description>
