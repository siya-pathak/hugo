      <description>PizzaBae is a simple and user-friendly chatbot built on Telegram that helps customers order pizza quickly and easily.
Customers can interact with PizzaBae via natural language, which makes it easier to navigate through the ordering process. Users simply message the chatbot, and it guides them through the process of selecting their preferred toppings, size, and crust, and then places the order for them. On finalizing of the order the customer is redirected to the checkout page.</description>
