      <description>This was built as part of a hackathon by team of 4.
Users have an option to schedule a waste pickup request, at a particular date and time at his chosen location (via map or geolocation). The pickup request can be no less than 24 hours in advance. Users can mention the amount of waste for disposal, choose what categories of waste are present for disposal as well as optionally snap a picture of the waste.</description>
